The amount and type of information that ShuttleCloud gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, users of our email migration product provide email addresses and its credentials.\n            <br>\n            Those who engage in transactions with ShuttleCloud – by purchasing paid migrations, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ShuttleCloud collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ShuttleCloud. When migrating email accounts, ShuttleCloud only stores the email credentials while the migration is in process or until the client confirms that the migration has finished successfully. ShuttleCloud also stores the folder names and the message identification numbers for logging purposes and to inform the user of the progress of the migration. ShuttleCloud does not store any other email data, like the content of email messages, at any point during or after the migration. ShuttleCloud does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\n          "},{subtitle:"Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information",text:"ShuttleCloud discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ShuttleCloud’s behalf or to provide services available at ShuttleCloud’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ShuttleCloud’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ShuttleCloud will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ShuttleCloud discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ShuttleCloud believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ShuttleCloud, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ShuttleCloud website and have supplied your email address, ShuttleCloud may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ShuttleCloud and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
